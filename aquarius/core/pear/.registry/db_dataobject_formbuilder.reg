For having a quick but working prototype of your application, simply model the database, run DataObject's createTable script over it and write a script that passes one of the resulting objects to the FormBuilder class. The FormBuilder will automatically generate a simple but working HTML_QuickForm object that you can use to test your application. It also provides a processing method that will automatically detect if an insert() or update() command has to be executed after the form has been submitted. If you have set up DataObject's links.ini file correctly, it will also automatically detect if a table field is a foreign key and will populate a selectbox with the linked table's entries. There are many optional parameters that you can place in your DataObjects.ini or in the properties of your derived classes, that you can use to fine-tune the form-generation, gradually turning the prototypes into fully-featured forms, and you can take control at any stage of the process.";s:4:"lead";a:2:{i:0;a:4:{s:4:"name";s:13:"Justin Patrin";s:4:"user";s:12:"justinpatrin";s:5:"email";s:20:"justinpatrin@php.net";s:6:"active";s:3:"yes";}i:1;a:4:{s:4:"name";s:12:"Markus Wolff";s:4:"user";s:6:"mw21st";s:5:"email";s:14:"mw21st@php.net";s:6:"active";s:3:"yes";}}s:9:"developer";a:4:{s:4:"name";s:15:"Norbert Mocsnik";s:4:"user";s:7:"norbert";s:5:"email";s:15:"norbert@php.net";s:6:"active";s:3:"yes";}s:4:"date";s:10:"2006-03-01";s:4:"time";s:8:"09:13:37";s:7:"version";a:2:{s:7:"release";s:8:"1.0.0RC4";s:3:"api";s:8:"1.0.0RC4";}s:9:"stability";a:2:{s:7:"release";s:4:"beta";s:3:"api";s:4:"beta";}s:7:"license";a:2:{s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:3:"uri";s:26:"http://www.php.net/license";}s:8:"_content";s:11:"PHP License";}s:5:"notes";s:838:"(Fixed since 1.0.0RC3)

Changes
* BC Break! The QuickForm driver no longer extends the FormBuilder main class
** This means that extended versions of FormBuilder are no longer tied to a specific driver, however
** If you have created your own FormBuilder extended class in the past you now need to alter it to
** extend DB_DataObject_FormBuilder instead of DB_DataObject_FormBuilder_QuickForm

** If you are instantiation your FormBuilder object with "new" you should switch to using DB_DataObject_FormBuilder::create()

Fixes
* validateOnProcess no longer fails when linkNewValue is used

New Features
* There are now callback options to allow custom functions to be set for:
** preGenerateForm
** postGenerateForm
** preProcessForm
** postProcessForm
** prepareLinekdDataObject

** Note: useCallTimePassByRef is now needed only if you use the FormBuilder parameter in the getForm callback

* If you set the 'collapse' key of a crossLink array to true, the unselected crossLink records will be hidden until you click the "Show All" link beneath them.

-- If only a time is passed to _date2Array it will prepend today's date so that PEAR::Date will process it correctly
-- You no longer have to have all 3 date fields specified for a date to be output from _array2date
--- For example, f only a day is specified, it will put 0000 for year and 00 for month
--- The same applies to times *except* that seconds will only be output of they are specified
---- If only an hour and minute are specified (or only one of the 2) you will get H:i with no s
---- If only seconds are specified you would get 0 for hour and minute";}i:20;a:5:{s:7:"version";a:2:{s:7:"release";s:6:"0.11.1";s:3:"api";s:6:"0.11.1";}s:9:"stability";a:2:{s:7:"release";s:4:"beta";s:3:"api";s:4:"beta";}s:4:"date";s:10:"2005-01-08";s:7:"license";a:2:{s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:3:"uri";s:26:"http://www.php.net/license";}s:8:"_content";s:11:"PHP License";}s:5:"notes";s:3097:"0.11.1 adds a file missing in the 0.11.0 release
Lots of new options, bug fixes, and a few changes. Check the wiki for more detailed info on new options.
fixes:
- Re-added support for timeElementFormat option
- Re-added "copy" support for dbDateFormat (although it is not currently used)
- Auto-generated form name is now always lowercase to ensure identical behaviour in PHP4 and PHP5
- Fixed hidePrimaryKey issues when set in the ini file
- Moved the rest of the driver-specific to the QuickForm driver
- Changed crossLink and tripleLink code to use setDefaults (bug #2913)
- Fix tripleLinks not holding their value after a submit (related to bug #2913)
- Added support for all date format types specified in bug# 2375
   NOTE: 'l' and 'D' types are supported by _date2Array, but not _array2Date. This means they can be output, but upon submission they do nothing.
- Fixed freezing problems with crossLinks and tripleLinks (bug #2915)
   A new QuickForm element type has been created for this. It is in DB/DataObject/FormBuilder/QuickForm/ElementTable.php. This element creates an HTML_Table with rows of elements. The table may or may not have row and column headers. Any QF element may be in each cell.
- Fixed bug where time elements were created with 'date' type options (this should change nothing unless you use elementTypeMap)
- 0 as primary key no longer causes unwanted insert (bug #2979)
- Fixed elementNamePrefix and elementNamePostfix when used with crosslink and triplelink and dates
  [ and ] are no longer allowed in the prefix and postfix
changes:
- The Primary Key is now retrieved using a new internal method (_getPrimaryKey) which looks first in the _primary_key property of the DataObject, then tries sequenceKey(), then the first element in keys()
- Added patch to "sync" crosslinks and triplelinks instead of deleting all and recreating (Bug #2841)
- The numeric rule will only be set if FB creates the element (bug #3042)
- Renamed getDataObjectSelectDisplayValue() to getDataObjectString()
new:
- Added multi-select support to QF driver
- Re-added multi-select support for crossLinks
- Added casting of '' to NULL for link fields (for selectAddEmpty)
- Added automatic entry of an empty option for link fields which are not DB_DATAOBJECT_NOTNULL
- Added selectAddEmpty support for enum fields
- Enum fields will automatically have an empty option if they are allowed to be NULL (same as for links)
- Added a new crossLinkExtraFields option for crossLinks which allows editing of extra fields in the crosslink table
- Added prepareLinkedDataObject callback for DO to customize link options (bug #2958)
- Added elementTypeAttributes and fieldAttributes configuration options to QF driver
- Added a new option: useCallTimePassByReference which defaults to false (bug #2658)
- Added support for reverseLinks (request #2889)
- Added support for boolean fields. Boolean fields are rendered as checkboxes
- Added new option booleanFields
- getDataObjectString() is now statically callable

If you have already used FormBuilder in your current projects, please read all of this very carefully!

MAJOR BC BREAKS -- Please read all comments below before trying to use this version!
This checkin is the result of an attempt at unifying the various parts of the FormBuilder API, unifying the coding styles, and conforming to PEAR CS. This *will* break your application.

All options are now configurable through the DataObject. Any option that could be in the FormBuilder can now be in the DataObject.

All options in the DataObject now have a "fb_" prefix to distinguish them from field names.

All options in both the FormBuilder and DataObject were changed to use studlyCaps instead_of_underscores.

Some few options have changed names. For example, follow_links is now linkDisplayLevel.

All options may be specified in the [DB_DataObject_FormBuilder] section of the ini file. For options that are DataObject specific, these are set as defaults. The DataObject may change them through its options. linkDisplayFields and linkOrderFields (see below) are arrays and set the same as elementTypeMap.

All options in the [DB_DataObject_FormBuilder] section of the ini file are copied into the FormBuilder when it is instantiated. Hence, changing $GLOBALS['_DB_DATAOVJECT_FORMBUILDER']['CONFIG'] after you create your FormBuilder will no longer work.

All options in the DataObject (except for those that start with "select") are copied to the FormBuilder after preGenerateForm is called. This is to cut down on the internal complexity of FormBuilder. This means that you cannot change options in the DataObject after preGenerateForm (such as in postGenerateForm). We don't see this as a problem as you can set everything up before then and (nearly) all options are used once postGenerateForm is called. If you know of a problem with this, please send us an e-mail or a bug report. This also means that you cannot re-use a FormBuilder object as the settings of the previous FormBuilder will persist.

The database.formBuilder.ini file is no longer used. Select display and order fields should be put in the DO file as linkDisplayFields and linkOrderFields. The fix0.9.0Files.php script will move these options into your DataObject classes automatically.

If you were previously using the 0.9.0 release, the script in CVS called fix0.9.0Files.php should be able to fix all BC breaks in your code and ini files. If it doesn't please send an e-mail to justinpatrin@php.net so that I can fix it. You can download the script from this URL: http://cvs.php.net/pear/DB_DataObject_FormBuilder/fix0.9.0Files.php

If you were previously using a CVS version of FormBuilder.php after 1.36 up to 1.52, the script in CVS called fixPre1.52CVSFiles.php should be able to fix any BC problems you have. All this script does is rename sleect*Fields to link*Fields. You can download the script from this URL: http://cvs.php.net/pear/DB_DataObject_FormBuilder/fixPre1.52CVSFiles.php

For a list of all changes, please see the CVS changelogs for FormBuilder.php. Of particular interest should be the changelog for CVS version 1.37.

FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS AND MODIFICATIONS:
- Added crossLinkSeparator option
- Added TIME element handling (Thanks to Frank Fahs)
- Added support for ENUM select or radio generation
3 new options: enumFields, enumOptions, and enumOptionsCallback

- New configuration option "elementTypeMap": Allows you to define
  a list of FormBuilder field types and HTML_QuickForm element types
  that should be used for those field types. This way, you can for
  example use a WYSYWIG HTML editing component instead of textareas.
- New configuration options: "dateToDatabaseCallback" and
  "dateFromDatabaseCallback" allow you to define callback functions
  for date format conversion. This way, you can use any input and
  storage format for dates that you desire.
- Fixed bug #624: Incompatibility with schema files generated by
  DB_DataObject 1.4.0 and up. Side-effect: FormBuilder now also
  recognizes DATE, DATETIME and TEXT fields automatically, so there
  is no more need to use class properties to define them manually.
- Conversion of ISO dates to QuickForm date arrays no longer
  relies on strtotime(), but uses PEAR::Date instead to get rid of the
  date range limitations of Unix timestamps
- You can now also use DATETIME fields, as more formatting
  options for date fields are supported (m,M,d,Y,H,i,s)
- New experimental option "dateFieldLanguage" allows setting the
  language for date fields, this doesn't seem to work yet though
- useForm() now knows a second parameter that allows to add elements
  from an existing form to the generated one ... this, too, is to be considered
  highly experimental as the current implementation relies on supposedly private
  QuickForm properties to be public
- Support for a new callback method in your DataObjects: "dateOptions()"
  allows to return an option array for all or individual date elements. See docs
  for QuickForm's date element for details on possible options
- Added support for recursive link lookups (by Justin Patrin)
- Implemented changes by Norbert Moscnik:
  a) added "fieldsToRender" configuration option
  b) added "userEditableFields" configuration option
  c) added "forced_values" configuration option
  d) additional empty option (value="") as the first element of the <select> lists
- Fixed file upload handling: http://pear.php.net/bugs/bug.php?id=423
- Added usage of setter methods: http://pear.php.net/bugs/bug.php?id=422
- When processing the form, the new getUserEditableFields() method is used
  to check against manipulated POST requests
- Added support for definition of display_fields and custom field ordering in
  a separate .ini file (contributed by Justin Patrin)
- Fixed: Threw notices when no primary key was detected in processForm().
  Will now exit and return false.
- Added: New method forceQueryType() will let you override the autodetection
  for the query command (insert/update) using new predefined constants.
- Fixed inconsistency with documentation regarding hide_primary_key (spotted by Norbert Mocsnik)
- Fixed bug with checks for postProcess() and preProcess() user-methods, spotted by Ron McClain
- Fixed bug that occured when building selectboxes (if select_order_field was not defined,
  and the linked class had its own select_display_field property, FormBuilder was trying
  to order by a nonexisting field)
- Fixed small issue in processForm method (detection if submitted values really belong 
  to the current DataObject)
- Minor change in configuration method (check inline docs!!)
- New options "createSubmit" and "submitText" to set creation of
  a submit button on/off and specify its text
- fix bug preventing the options array from being used (Arnaud Limbourg)
- use raiseError instead of new PEAR_Error, use a variable to make php5 happy (Arnaud Limbourg)
- Automatically making the primary key a hidden field is now optional
- Fixed notices when working with E_ALL
- Fixed bug with element reordering (Arnaud Limbourg)
- Additions and corrections in inline docs
- Changed bullshit implementation: Existing form objects are no longer passed
  through the options array, but by using a new method useForm().";}i:26;a:5:{s:7:"version";a:2:{s:7:"release";s:5:"0.8.2";s:3:"api";s:5:"0.8.2";}s:9:"stability";a:2:{s:7:"release";s:4:"beta";s:3:"api";s:4:"beta";}s:4:"date";s:10:"2003-08-28";s:7:"license";a:2:{s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:3:"uri";s:26:"http://www.php.net/license";}s:8:"_content";s:11:"PHP License";}s:5:"notes";s:291:"New features:
